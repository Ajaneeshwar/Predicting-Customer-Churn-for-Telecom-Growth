# Predicting Customer Churn for Telecom Growth

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, impacting revenue directly. This project tackles this problem by developing a predictive model to forecast customer attrition, aiding telecom operators in implementing effective retention strategies. 

## Key Features

- **Churn Prediction Model**: Forecasts customer churn to help devise proactive retention strategies.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Utilizes innovative feature engineering and selection techniques.
- **Performance Metrics**: Achieved up to 93.3% AUC by integrating Social Network Analysis (SNA) features.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Evaluated Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), and XGBoost, with XGBoost showing superior performance.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Installation**:
    - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Required Python Packages**:
    - Install the necessary packages using `pip`. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib jupyter
    ```

3. **Jupyter Notebook**:
    - Install Jupyter Notebook if you havenâ€™t already:
    ```sh
    pip install notebook
    ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ajaneeshwar/Predicting-Customer-Churn-for-Telecom-Growth.git
    cd Predicting-Customer-Churn-for-Telecom-Growth
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required Python packages as listed in the prerequisites.

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. **Run the Notebook**:
