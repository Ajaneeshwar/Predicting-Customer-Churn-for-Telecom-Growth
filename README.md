# Predicting Customer Churn for Telecom Growth

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, impacting revenue directly. This project tackles this problem by developing a predictive model to forecast customer attrition, aiding telecom operators in implementing effective retention strategies.

## Key Features

- **Churn Prediction Model**: Forecasts customer churn to help devise proactive retention strategies.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Utilizes innovative feature engineering and selection techniques.
- **Performance Metrics**: Achieved up to 93.3% AUC by integrating Social Network Analysis (SNA) features.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Evaluated Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), and XGBoost, with XGBoost showing superior performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.x**: Install from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Install using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install notebook
    ```

3. **Required Python Packages**: Install using pip from the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file includes packages such as:
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`
    - `scikit-learn`
    - `xgboost`
    - `matplotlib`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ajaneeshwar/Predicting-Customer-Churn-for-Telecom-Growth.git
    cd Predicting-Customer-Churn-for-Telecom-Growth
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook set up, then install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
